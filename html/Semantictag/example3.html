    <p>
      Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different
      purposes. Thus, some static dos and donts are always of use in the fluid
      zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features:
      maintainability, dependability, and usability. It should also be adaptable
      enough to be efficient even in changing environments. However, before
      coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to
      provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be written.
    </p>
<section id="prerequisites">
    <h2 >PREREQUISITES</h2>
    <p>
      This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code
      may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to
      be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and
      architecture. An important question is how development is structured. What
      is the specific purpose of the software? The problem that the code is
      meant to solve must be clear to the developer. What is the design of the
      individual components? Such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a
      good code is being written.

      <li>
        <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
        <p>
          Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers,
          especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers.
          However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
        <p>
          Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often
          developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them
          with meaningful names.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
        <p>
          The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain
          result, developers may use complex logic but this should be minimised
          while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may
          use it for a different purpose and may not even completely understand
          or utilise the complex logic.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
        <p>
          Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains
          values referring to absolute parameters such as file names, URLs or IP
          addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different design.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>TESTING</h3>
        <p>
          Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases
          must be planned while the code is being written, and they are
          developed while an application is coded.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
        <p>
          While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout.
          Though it is fine for smaller programs to be debugged after they have
          been written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
        <p>
          Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The
          installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated regularly.
        </p>
